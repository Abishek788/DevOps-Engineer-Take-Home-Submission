# üìä DevOps Engineer Take-Home Assessment   --Abishek kc 

This project demonstrates a monitoring, alerting, and visualization system suitable for ensuring system reliability at scale. It uses modern DevOps tools like **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **Node Exporter**, **Alertmanager**, and **Docker Compose** to monitor server health and notify the team when things go wrong.

---

## üìå Overview

At Linq, maintaining infrastructure uptime, performance, and reliability is critical. This solution provides:

- ‚úÖ Real-time monitoring of system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- ‚úÖ Alerting on high resource usage
- ‚úÖ Visualization through a Grafana dashboard
- ‚úÖ Scalable architecture with Docker Compose

---

## üöÄ Part 1: Monitoring Design

### ‚úÖ Metrics to Monitor
- **CPU Usage**
- **Memory Usage**
- **Disk Usage**
- **Network Latency / I/O**

### üß∞ Tools to Collect Metrics
- [Node Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter): Exposes system metrics
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io): Scrapes and stores metrics


### üíæ Metrics Storage Backend
- **Prometheus** is used as the time-series database for its integration with alerting and Grafana

---

## üö® Part 2: Alerting

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Alert Conditions
- CPU usage > 85% for more than 2 minutes
- Memory usage > 90%
- Disk usage > 90%
- Node down/unreachable

### üîî Delivery Methods
- Slack (via Webhook)

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools for Alerting
- **Prometheus Alertmanager** routes alerts to configured receivers
- Integrated with Slack using a webhook URL

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Part 3: Implementation & Scalability

### üß™ Minimal Working System
Deployed with **Docker Compose**, includes:

- **Prometheus** ‚Äì metrics storage
- **Node Exporter** ‚Äì system metrics collector
- **Grafana** ‚Äì dashboard visualizer
- **Alertmanager** ‚Äì alert delivery system

### üìà Scalability
- Add more servers by installing Node Exporter on each and updating Prometheus targets
- Use service discovery (e.g., Kubernetes, DNS, EC2 tags) for dynamic scaling
- Grafana supports templated dashboards for multiple nodes

---

## üìä Part 4: Visualization Dashboard

### üñ•Ô∏è Grafana Setup

1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Login: `admin / admin`
3. Add Prometheus data source: `http://prometheus:9090`
4. Import dashboard ID **1860** (Node Exporter Full)

## üß± Tools Used (and Why!)

| Tool             | Purpose | Why I Chose It |
|------------------|---------|----------------|
| **Node Exporter** | Collects system metrics like CPU, RAM, Disk | It's lightweight, easy to use, and the official Prometheus exporter |
| **Prometheus**   | Scrapes and stores metrics data | Open-source, powerful, and integrates perfectly with alerting and Grafana |
| **Alertmanager** | Sends alerts via Slack (or email/SMS) | Comes with Prometheus and supports many notification methods |
| **Grafana**      | Shows metrics in a nice dashboard | Very popular, highly customizable, and easy to connect to Prometheus |
| **Docker Compose** | Runs all tools together | Makes the whole setup easy to run with just one command |

---

## üîÑ How It All Works Together

Here‚Äôs how the system flows step-by-step:

1. **Node Exporter** runs on a server and collects data like:
   - CPU usage
   - Memory usage
   - Disk space
   - Network stats

2. **Prometheus** checks Node Exporter every 15 seconds and stores that data in a time-series database.

3. If any metrics go above your thresholds (like CPU > 85%), **Prometheus sends an alert to Alertmanager**.

4. **Alertmanager** then sends that alert to Slack (or email/SMS), so the team knows something‚Äôs wrong.

5. **Grafana** connects to Prometheus and shows all that data on cool visual charts.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Alert Rules

Here‚Äôs an example of when an alert will fire:

- If **CPU usage is above 85% for more than 2 minutes**, send an alert.
- If **Memory usage is above 90%**
- If **Disk usage is above 90%**
- If the **server is unreachable**

These conditions are written in `alert.rules.yml`.
